# Classification with KNN and Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the application of two popular classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression. It focuses on implementing these algorithms for predictive modeling, using real-world data to classify and analyze patterns.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for:
- Implementing **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** and **Logistic Regression** for classification tasks.
- Using **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation** to assess the performance of both models.
- Applying the models on a **real-world dataset** to make predictions and analyze the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **UniversalBank dataset**, which contains information about bank customers and their behaviors. This dataset is used to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan.

### Dataset Description
- **Attributes**:
  - `Age`, `Experience`, `Income`, `Family`, `CCAge`, `Education`, `Mortgage`, `Personal Loan`, `Securities Account`, `CD Account`, `Online`, `CreditCard`
  
The dataset is available in the repository as `UniversalBank.csv`.
